## **Description:** 
We are creating a website that informs users on US government access to data.

### Minimally:
We will have a homepage that states background information like:
    - Ways they can obtain data (Data Brokers, warrants, etc)
    - Laws in place that pertain to the issue
    - Why this is an issue, and a call to action on transperancy for both companies providing data and the government

A newsfeed page that contains articles pertaining to the issue for users to stay informed:
    - At least 5 recent articles (within the past 5 years) that pertain to Data Privacy
