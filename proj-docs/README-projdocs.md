# Contains project documentation from project planning

## Part 1: 
Understanding the Problem (Chapter 2). This chapter is geared toward creating a product to sell, and so doesn’t directly translate to this project. However, the principle is essentially the same, and you will need to:
- Understand the domain. That is, you need to thoroughly research and understand your topic. Your website does not need to (and probably should not) include all of the information you learn, but it is important that you have a thorough understanding of your topic as you begin to make design decisions for your website.
- Understand the users. For this project, the goal is to create a website that educates a general audience on your topic. So, you need to understand this audience, and what they already know (or think they know) about your topic. Most likely, you will do this by gathering feedback through surveys and/or interviews of potential users.

For Part 1 of the final project, you will complete the first step listed above, “Understanding the Problem”. This includes both understanding the domain and understanding the users. Your group will submit a document containing the following information.
- Understand the domain: list sources that you used, and information that you’ve learned from these sources. This can be written informally, as notes.
- Understand the users: describe your strategy for understanding your users. Did you do surveys or interviews? What questions did you ask? List the information gathered in this step. This can also be written informally, as notes.

- Write a summary of your findings from your domain research and user research. Especially highlight information that will help you design or plan your website.
